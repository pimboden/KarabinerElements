This file contains rules for the programm Karabiner Elements, that helps me switch quicly from my main OS Windows to MAC OS

It contains mainly 2 complex rule.sets

1) for using for my main VSCode Shortcuts ctrl instead of option (I don't replace all command with ctrl!) Just selected shortcuts.

2) for using my windows keyboard Logitech ERGO K860. It maps most Keys as it are on the keyborad. (Â¦ --> couldn't find it on MacOs)
